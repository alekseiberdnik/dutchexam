          <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

          <h2>General</h2>

          <h3>What is DutchExam.online?</h3>
          <p>
            DutchExam.online is an online practice platform for the Dutch integration exams.
            The first version focuses on Reading (Lezen) and Knowledge of Dutch Society (KNM)
            at around A2–B1 level.
          </p>

          <h3>Is this an official exam?</h3>
          <p>
            No. DutchExam.online is an independent practice tool. We are not connected to DUO
            or the official inburgering organisation. The goal is to help you feel confident
            before you take the real exam.
          </p>

          <h3>What tests can I take?</h3>
          <p>
            At the moment we offer two free tests:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Quick test (15 minutes)</strong> &mdash; short check of your reading and KNM skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep test (45 minutes)</strong> &mdash; longer session that feels closer to a real exam block.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Scores &amp; attempts</h2>

          <h3>What can I do with my score?</h3>
          <p>
            Your score is for self-assessment only. It helps you understand how comfortable you are
            with typical exam tasks and where you might need more practice.
          </p>

          <h3>How often can I repeat the tests?</h3>
          <p>
            You can repeat both the quick test and the deep test as many times as you like.
            In the future we will limit high-stakes certificates, but practice sessions will stay flexible.
          </p>

          <h2>Technical</h2>

          <h3>Which browser should I use?</h3>
          <p>
            The site works best in the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.
            For the smoothest experience, we recommend using a laptop with a stable internet connection.
          </p>

          <h3>What happens if I lose connection or close the tab?</h3>
          <p>
            If the browser closes or you lose connection during a test, that session is interrupted
            and you may need to start again.
          </p>

          <h2>Account &amp; data</h2>

          <h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, you sign up with your email so we can link your attempts to your profile and
            eventually show progress over time.
          </p>

          <h3>How do you handle my data?</h3>
          <p>
            We store your basic account information (email) and your test attempts.
            We do not sell your personal data. You can read the full details in our
            <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I delete my account?</h3>
          <p>
            During the MVP phase you can contact us if you wish to remove your data.
            In later versions you will be able to manage this directly from your profile.
